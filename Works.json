        "summary": "Soo-Mi is a Messenger and Diplomat under Kyo’s employ, but in truth, she mostly acts as a Mediator amongst Lycans in spite of her not being a Werewolf. As one of three Nature Spirits, one who is representative of “Dreams,” she is unusually empathetic and carefree. At the same time, it is accurate to describe her as “disturbing” and contradictorily incompatible and compatible with Life outside of other Lycans.",

Yet even with her fixation on permanence, she doesn’t seem to care about her own life—as if dying isn’t a fear she has. An action only taken for it is rational to seek permanence. To achieve permanence and thus security. An extreme rational egoist to her core that is willing to commit countless atrocities for as long as it has purpose. Many believe her goal to be defying the natural order and attaining “Divinity” for immortality…yet in truth—the only way to attain absolute Divinity is when you are the only divinity left on the board.",

One whose light was to be followed as an example. Yet, she who wished to heal the world and aid all the land, was one burdened with great pain and sorrow...A fallen angel.",

Somebody who lives only by the ideal they were shaped by and for, that of Magic, and nothing more. Or perhaps she was empty from the moment she was born.",
